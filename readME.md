Certainly! Here's a combined README.md file that includes the information from all three scripts:

```markdown
# Genomic Analysis Scripts

This repository contains scripts for various genomic analysis tasks, including alignment hit table analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and neural network regression.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow (for neural network script)

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib tensorflow
```

## Alignment Hit Table Linear Regression

### Script Details

This script performs linear regression analysis on an alignment hit table dataset.

#### Steps:

1. **Read the CSV File:**

   The script reads the CSV file, assigns column names, and processes the data.

2. **Feature Selection:**

   Features and the target variable are selected from the dataset.

3. **Normalization:**

   Features are normalized using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.

4. **Linear Regression:**

   A linear regression model is trained on the normalized features and target variable.

5. **Visualization:**

   The script visualizes the actual vs predicted bit score using seaborn and matplotlib.

#### Usage

1. Place the CSV file in the same directory as the script. Ensure your CSV file is named `Alignment-HitTable.csv`.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python alignment_hit_table_linear_regression.py
   ```

## PCA Analysis Script

### Script Details

This script performs principal component analysis (PCA) on genomic data.

#### Steps:

1. **Read the Fasta File:**

   The script reads the FASTA file containing genomic sequences.

2. **Preprocessing:**

   Genomic sequences are processed to extract relevant features.

3. **PCA:**

   PCA is performed on the processed genomic data.

4. **Visualization:**

   The script visualizes the principal components using seaborn and matplotlib.

#### Usage

1. Place the FASTA file in the same directory as the script. Ensure your FASTA file is named `genomic_sequences.fasta`.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python pca_analysis_script.py
   ```

## Neural Network Regression Script

### Script Details

This script trains a neural network regression model on genomic data.

#### Steps:

1. **Read the Data:**

   The script reads the data from the alignment hit table CSV file.

2. **Feature Selection:**

   Features and the target variable are selected from the dataset.

3. **Normalization:**

   Features are normalized using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.

4. **Model Training:**

   A neural network regression model is trained using TensorFlow.

5. **Evaluation:**

   The trained model is evaluated, and predictions are made.

#### Usage

1. Place the CSV file in the same directory as the script. Ensure your CSV file is named `Alignment-HitTable.csv`.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python neural_network_regression_script.py
   ```
